All config files are read in the same way:
	- Default branch is queried and all its data is read-in.
	- Bespoke branch is queried if requested and its data is read-in, overwriting any default attributes.
	- If the bespoke branch is not found, the system falls back to the default branch.

This means that any changes to default will affect ALL children.
Please remember this when editing the configs!

Default branches should contain all possible parameters of their children set to default values.
Children should then contain bespoke values for their intended purpose.

Every config must start with a default branch.
Worth noting some configs, such as game_core may not require any children branches.

The game will ONLY PARSE ONE OBJECT DEEP. It will not recurse any further.
Make sure to only go one object deep within each branch, do not make extra children objects.

Config-specific notes:
	- tile_w and tile_h define the size of a room in rooms_core
	- width and height define the size of a tile relative to the game window in tiles_core
